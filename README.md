## Overview and Description

This is a React application with a Node.js backend that stores data in a Mongo database. This application's purpose is to make a multi-user to-do list tracking system easier. Users may create new to-do items on the front end, which are saved with a task, assignee, and difficulty rating. Tasks can be modified, removed, or finished (but not deleted). Viewing capability is included in, allowing you to conceal completed tasks or arrange the task list by assignee, task (alphabetical), or difficulty rating. Pagination has been introduced to the list viewing window, as well as a drop down option that allows the user to choose how many tasks will be presented each page.
